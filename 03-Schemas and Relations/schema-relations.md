# Data Schemas & Data Modelling

Start of a project: how do you want to model your data?

## Why Do We Use Schemas

MongoDB does not enforce schemas, but does that mean you shouldn't use them?

1. Schema in MongoDB is really the structure of the data
    - You can insert two different types of data into one collection
1. For clarity's sake, you should implement some type of schema
1. In the real world, a mongoDB database will do one of 2 things
    - Full SQL (schema based, documents in a collection match)
    - Partial SQL (schema based, all documents share base items, but some have more)

## Data Types

- [MongoDB BSON Types](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/index.html)
- [MongoDB Type Limits](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/)

1. Text: "Gary"
    - 16mb limit for text length
1. Boolean: true or false
1. Number
    - integer (int32)
    - NumberLong (int64)
    - NumberDecimal (high precision floats)
1. ObjectId
    - Auto generated by MongoDB
    - Always unique and always in right order based on insert order
1. ISODate
    - "2018-09-09"
1. Timestamp
    - Usually used internally
    - Guaranteed unique
1. Embedded Document
    - 100 layers deep
1. Array
    - List of objects

## Modelling Schemas - How-to

1. Which data does my app need or generate?
    - User Info, Product Info, Orders
    - This will define the fields you'll need and how they related
1. Where do I need my Data?
    - Welcome Page, Products, List Page, Orders Page
    - Defines your req collections and field groupings
        - products collection, etc
1. Which kind of data or info do I want to display
    - Weclome Page: Product Names
    - Defines which queries you'll need
    - Don't want complex joins
1. How often do I fetch my data?
    - Every page reload?
    - Dteremes whether you should optimize for easy fetching
1. How often do I write or change my data?
    - Ordres => Often
    - Product Data => Rarely
    - Defines whether you should optimize for easy writing
    
## Relations

When you have multiple Collections that relate to each other in some way

1. Nested/Embedded Documents
    - Customer with embedded Address
1. References
    - You don't want duplicate data
    - Instead of embedding, include list of ids that match with another document in a different collection

## Schema Validation

[Schema Validation Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/)

1. We have a CRUD operation on a Collection
    - Then the schema will validate the incoming data based on schema we defined
    - Mongo will accept or deny if it passes
1. Can define a schema, the level and the action
    - Which documents get validated, what happens when it fails
    - How strict (warning vs error)
1. Note, the playground in VS Code doesn't seem to have this functionality yet
    - Use shell if you want to set it
    - I hope there's some gui eventually for this type of thing
