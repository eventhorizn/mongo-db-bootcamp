# Data Schemas & Data Modelling

Start of a project: how do you want to model your data?

## Why Do We Use Schemas

MongoDB does not enforce schemas, but does that mean you shouldn't use them?

1. Schema in MongoDB is really the structure of the data
    - You can insert two different types of data into one collection
1. For clarity's sake, you should implement some type of schema
1. In the real world, a mongoDB database will do one of 2 things
    - Full SQL (schema based, documents in a collection match)
    - Partial SQL (schema based, all documents share base items, but some have more)

## Data Types

1. Text: "Gary"
    - 16mb limit for text length
1. Boolean: true or false
1. Number
    - integer (int32)
    - NumberLong (int64)
    - NumberDecimal (high precision floats)
1. ObjectId
    - Auto generated by MongoDB
    - Always unique and always in right order based on insert order
1. ISODate
    - "2018-09-09"
1. Timestamp
    - Usually used internally
    - Guaranteed unique
1. Embedded Document
    - 100 layers deep
1. Array
    - List of objects
